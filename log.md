## V 0.0.3 

1) Introduces `BondDescriptorBond`.
    * This is effectively the same as `BondDescriptor` was previously. Now `BondDescriptor` unique within a 
   stochastic object and `BondDescriptorBond` now links to the unique `BondDescritor`.
    * Motivation: it makes validation of bonding descriptors simpler
2) Additional validation add around bonding descriptors.

## V 0.0.2

First stable release.
