This site contains the project documentation for the 'BigSMILES' project.


BigSMILES is a structurally based line notation based on the highly successful 
SMILES (simplified molecular-input line-entry system) representation.  
It provides extensions over regular SMILES, which can only represent molecules with given deterministic 
molecular structures, and support the representation of molecules that are characterized by a distribution of 
distinct molecular structures instead of a single well-defined structure. This feature is designed specifically to 
reflect the stochastic nature of polymer molecules. Since polymers are macromolecules that usually have large molecular
weights, the line notation is termed BigSMILES.
