## Goals of the project

The main goal of this project is to provide a lightweight parsing and validation of any SMILES/BigSMILES string that
can be the building off point for other cheminformatics.


With that said; this package will also try to support additional representations and algorithms related to 
chemiformatics as optional features (and optional dependencies).
